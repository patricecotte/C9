<h1>The history behind this Calculator</h1>
The idea for this advanced calculator came out of the boringness and dullness 
from other calculators that come on most personal computers.
<p>
With some of these calculators user cannot user the keyboard, making impossible to modify
the contents of the screen. 
</p>
<p>
These calculators generally look poor and second-class applications.
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>The revival of the Calculator</h2>
<p>
This calculator has been thought out in order to be fun and improve your experience. It also gives you
the freedom to make this calculator unique and really yours by changing its appearance.
This version is release 1.0
